## Description

* Perform a descriptive analysis of the data looking for common patterns among customers.
* Build a clustering model for the different types of customers by selecting the variables considered most appropriate for the study.
* Using a scorecard, visualize the most relevant aspects of the descriptive together with the possibility of grouping a new customer with one of the previous clusters.

What do customers in the same cluster have in common?
